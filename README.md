## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/bleu/silo-hf-monitor.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd silo-hf-monitor
   ```
3. Install dependencies (we use pnpm as the package manager):
   ```sh
   pnpm install
   ```

## Configuration

1. Export environment variables, e.g:
   ```sh
    export DATABASE_PRIVATE_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432
    export TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=...
    export TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_URL=...
    export PONDER_RPC_URL_MAINNET=...
    export PONDER_RPC_URL_OPTIMISM=...
    export PONDER_RPC_URL_ARBITRUM=...
    export PONDER_RPC_URL_BASE=...
   ```

## Running the Project

### 1. Set Up the Database with Docker

The project uses PostgreSQL as the database, which you can run via Docker. Use the provided `docker-compose.yml` file to set up the PostgreSQL service:

Start Docker Compose:

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start a PostgreSQL container with the name `silo-hc-monitor-postgres`. The database will be accessible at `localhost:5432` with the credentials defined in the compose file.

Ensure the database is running correctly by checking the container status:

```sh
docker ps
```

The database is now ready to store the subscriptions and health factor monitoring data.

### 2. Run Development Scripts

The project has several services to run concurrently during development: the notifier, indexer, bot, and the Ponder process. You can use the predefined `pnpm` scripts for these tasks.

#### Running All Services Concurrently

To run all services (Ponder, Bot, Notifier, and Indexer) simultaneously during development, use the `dev:all` script:

```sh
pnpm dev:all
```

This uses `concurrently` to run all the services in parallel, allowing you to work on multiple components of the project seamlessly.

#### Running Individual Services

Ponder: `pnpm dev`
Telegram Bot: `pnpm dev:bot`
Indexer: `pnpm dev:indexer`
Notifier: `pnpm dev:notifier`.

### 3. Migrations

For any database schema updates, you can run migrations for the bot service as follows:

```sh
pnpm migrate:bot
```

### 5. Linting and Type Checking

To ensure the code follows standard conventions and is free from type errors, you can run:

#### Linting:

```sh
pnpm lint
```

#### Type Checking:

```sh
pnpm typecheck
```
